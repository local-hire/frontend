// Should make this for all items, and another one for single items - so that users are able to see overall results.

// There should also be a page that displays a table of conversion rates.  

// This page takes the number of views of a particular item / or a users total views of their products, and then looks at how many bookings have resulted from the views of the products.

//we should then give an average of all conversions - or perhaps by category to give the useran indication of how they are tracking in terms of conversion
