        Notes:

        Notes on User Dashboard / Home:

- Their booking Calendar - things they have hired, are hiring
- Their reviews and ratings
- Their saved items
- Their ‘shared’ items
- if not a lender then encouragement to become one
- an ‘invite friends area’
- “Become a lender / go to lender dashboard” - this will be wrapped in an if /else statement depending on whether they are a lender or not.
- 
      </div>
