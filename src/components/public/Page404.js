    <div>
      404 PAGE

      As a user i donâ€™t want a generic 404 page, i want a 404 page that provides me with options so i can do something useful

      Notes on the 404 page:

- This should suit the styling of the rest of the site and provide options for the user:
- a search form
- become a lender
- see what charities / associations are supported by local hire in your area
- contact us if you think there should be something here
and a dinosaur
- 


    </div>
  )
}

export default Page404
