Notes for Terms of Service:

- The above have just been adapted from Shopify’s Terms of Service.  They have laid there’s out nicely.  
https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms
- We can probably adapt these to suit our needs.  Other thought - perhaps better to check out existing lending sites and look at their terms of service, and adapt those - i like the layout for shopify’s though especially the ‘which means’ area



USER STORIES

As a company we want to protect ourselves against borrower and lender stupidity so that we don’t face any legal troubles.

As a user i want to know that local hire has terms so that i can ignore them and use the service the way that i want to.
