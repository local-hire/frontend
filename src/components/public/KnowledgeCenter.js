Notes on Knowledge Center:

- This will essentially be a wiki that we create that answers common questions and how to’s - i.e. how to set the price, how to upload an image, when do i get paid, etc.  There are plenty online tutorials showing how to create a wiki, they seem pretty straight forward
- Each item is a link to a page within the wiki.

As a user I want to be able to find out the answer to any questions i have without having to contact local hire through the contact form.

As a lender I want to be able to find out the answer to any questions I have without having to contact local hire through the contact form.

As local hire we want to provide all users with the information they need without having to contact us so that we can spend our time creating a better service, instead of answering questions.
