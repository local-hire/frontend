      PRIVACY STATEMENT

      Notes on Privacy:

- We can copy and paste a privacy policy at the moment - go to a marketplace and get theirs, paste it into our view and voila we have a privacy statement.

USER STORIES

As a company we want to protect our users privacy so that we donâ€™t allow any of their personal details slip out into the public without their permission.

As a user i want to know that local hire respects my privacy.

export default PrivacyStatement
